# A Short Summary on Understanding the Technical Interview

## 1. Is coming up with the optimal solution the most important thing?
*From Mengfan:* 
- The interviewer is evaluating the analytical and problem-solving skills of the candidate.
- When given the problem, it is important to let the interview clearly know that I've understood the problem.
- It is always good to come up with an optimal solution; however, the first thing to do is always to come up with a working solution, which *can* be the brute-force solution; then, optimize it from there.
- After multiple attempts without solving it, it is no problem to seek hints; however, the key here is my thought process *after* given the hint.

*From Kenny:*
- They know that most people cannot give perfect solutions to the questions; thus, they also look at my *actions and reactions* when dealing with a hard problem. Even if I solve the question correctly, they'd still try to *push me a bit further just to see my limits*. 
- Just let the interviewer know if I have any questions - he/she is there to help me and it's not a bad thing in Google's interviews to ask for hints because it's a part of the interaction with the interviewer. 
- They'd rather seeing me ask questions than me solving the question without asking anything: **they'd assume that I've seen the question before, which might be considered cheating.**
- The ability of solving a problem I've never seen before is *more precious*.

I thought this statement is *gold* and it says the true purpose of technical interviews: **"What we do at Google are things no one has done before and we usually only have limited hints on how to finish our job."**

## 2. About teamwork and communication during technical interviews
*From Mengfan:*
There are two ways to demonstrate this:
1. Work experience in previous experience which is asked in a behavioral interview; if I want to express that "I'm an easy person to work with", I don't need to explicitly do that - my attitude and tone speak for myself. 
2. The communication between I and the interviewer during the technical interview - I must make sure that the interviewer understands what I'm thinking and doing. If he/she points out something, I must think about it and let him/her know that I'm thinking about it. 

*From Kenny:*
It is okay to be nervous and they *know* it. There are certain tips though:
1. Try as many interviews as possible before Google.
2. Do a lot of coding practices.

In terms of actively communicating with interviewers, there are some tricks:
1. **Repeat the question** - it is worse to come up with a solution to a wrong question.
2. **Propose my solution but don't write the code yet**. Run some **logical tests** with the interviewer. This ensures that I'm on the right track of answering the question and let the interviewer *scrutinize* my logic.
3. **State my intention**. It is important to ensure that the interviewer knows why I"m doing things I'm doing. It helps me write more accurate code and helps the interviewer understand me better.

There is also a weirdly pleasant trick: **treat the interviewer as my friend and imagine that we are working on a project together!**

## 3. How big companies evaluate technical abilities
*From Kenny:*
- At Google, every software engineer is bound to have the ability to pick up a new language/skill set in a short period of time; hence, the "amount" of my skills/tools I know is not a major consideration for them.
- I'd be better off if I focus on *1* language and master it.
- I need to keep my achievements not only at my "skills" section, but also my "work experience" section.
- However, if I'm interested in a start-up, focus on demonstrating my *cutting-edge skill set*.
